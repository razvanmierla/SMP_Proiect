IoT system for monitoring air quality

Faculty project where I had to design an IoT system for observing the air quality in the room.It measures temperature, humidity, CO2 and tVOC using an ESP8266 based board and 2 sensors, sending data over Wi-Fi. The most challenging part was learning from scratch how to control the sensors, as this was my first IoT project.
